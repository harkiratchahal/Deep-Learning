# 🧠 Deep Learning Specialization Labs

This repository contains my lab work, assignments, and notes for the **Deep Learning Specialization** by Andrew Ng and DeepLearning.AI. It covers the foundational concepts and practical implementations of deep learning using modern tools and libraries.

## 📚 Specialization Overview

This specialization consists of five structured courses:

1. **[Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning)**  
   Fundamentals of deep learning and neural networks.

2. **[Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network)**  
   Techniques to improve model performance and training efficiency.

3. **[Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects)**  
   Best practices for ML system design and troubleshooting.

4. **[Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks)**  
   Applications in computer vision using CNNs.

5. **[Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models)**  
   RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, and attention models for sequential data.
